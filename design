Client
======

Client takes the input from the user like "nslookup abc.com"
Client sends the input to the local server.
Client gets the IP Address and displays  it to the user.
If given hostname is not present local server returns error message


local Server
=============

gets the input from the client.
sends the IP address to client if it is present in its cache.
if it is not present in its cache then it splits the hostname from right to left and send the input to the root server.
root server responds with the corresponding tld servers IP address and portno.
now it again splits the hostname from right to left and send the input to the tld server
then it contacts the corresponding tld server for the corresponding authoritative server ip address.
Finally it sends the query to the authoritative server and gets the corresponding IP address.
Local server stores the IP address for the hostname and the hostname in its cache and sends it to the client.


Root Server
===========
The top level heirarchy of the query chain.
local server contacts the root server for the hostname.
sends the ip address and port number for the corresponding tld servers.

TLD server
==========

Local server contacts the TLD server upon receiving the IP address from the Root server.
The Tld server takes the input from the local server and sends the corresponding IP address for the responsible authoritative servers.
sends the IP address and port number of authoritative server to localserver


Authoritative Server
====================

The most important one in the network of WWW.
it acts as a guard protecting the IP address of the hosts and server.
when the local server gets the IP address of the authoritative server from the tld server it sends the one of the available IP address for controlling the network traffic.
sends the IP address to the local server for the requested host name

=============================
Local server maintains its cache.
before sending the Ip address to the client it stores the hostname and ip addresss in its cache.
when a query comes for the local server it first checks in its cache.
